## ✨ Key Features  

### 🔗 **Decentralized Database (IPFS)**
- We use the **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** to store facial data in a decentralized manner.  
- Eliminates single-point failures, making the system **virtually unhackable**.  
- Data is distributed across multiple nodes, ensuring **security and redundancy**.  

### 🎯 **Optimized Recognition Algorithms**
- Fine-tuned facial recognition models ensure **high accuracy**, even on **low-power hardware**.  
- Faster identification and verification processes.  
- **Minimized false positives and false negatives**.  

### 💾 **Local Hosting for Reliability**
- Operates **without continuous internet connectivity** for seamless use in remote areas.  
- Ensures **low-latency performance** by running the system locally.  

### 🔐 **Enhanced Security**
- End-to-end encryption to protect sensitive law enforcement data.  
- Ensures compliance with **data privacy laws** and **GDPR-equivalent security standards**.
